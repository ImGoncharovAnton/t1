This is an example of a simple task manager, an assignment for an internship at Leviossa IT.
This task manager was created following the example of Trello.
Used pure Javascript, html and scc.
Functions implemented:
1. Create new task boards
2. Create new tasks
3. Copy all tasks to a new board
4. Drag and drop tasks
5. Deleting tasks
6. Removing boards
7. For each double-click task, there is a modal window where you can add a description of the task, and any comments.
8. All data is stored in the browser's local storage.

In the future I plan to:
1. Add a search function for tasks and boards
2. Add a checklist in the task modal window
3. Add a progress bar for completing items from the checklist.
